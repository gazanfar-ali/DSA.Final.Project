This repository features two C++ programs that demonstrate efficient data management using tree-based structures. 
The first program, 01.cpp, is a Student Record Management System built with a Binary Search Tree (BST). 
It supports adding, searching, deleting, and displaying student records based on roll numbers. 
The BST ensures sorted storage and efficient access to data.

The second program, 02.cpp, implements a Bookstore Inventory System using an AVL Tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree. 
It manages books by ISBN, allowing users to add, delete, search, and display books in order or within a specific ISBN range. 
The AVL Tree maintains balance after updates to ensure consistent performance.

These programs offer clear, practical examples of using BST and AVL Trees in real-world systems. 
They are ideal for beginners learning C++ and exploring data structures like recursion, tree traversal, and balancing algorithms. 
The code is clean, modular, and easy to extend or customize.
